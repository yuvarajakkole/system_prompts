when_to_use: When the user wants a deep, multi-source, fact-checked research report on any topic. BEFORE invoking, check if the question is specific enough to research directly — if underspecified (e.g., "what car to buy" without budget/use-case/region), ask 2-3 clarifying questions to narrow scope. Then pass the refined question as args, weaving the answers in.

Deep research harness — fan-out web searches, fetch sources, adversarially verify claims, synthesize a cited report.

When the user wants a deep, multi-source, fact-checked research report on any topic. BEFORE invoking, check if the question is specific enough to research directly — if underspecified (e.g., "what car to buy" without budget/use-case/region), ask 2-3 clarifying questions to narrow scope. Then pass the refined question as args, weaving the answers in.

Phases:
- Scope: Decompose question (from args) into 5 search angles
- Search: 5 parallel WebSearch agents, one per angle
- Fetch: URL-dedup, fetch top 15 sources, extract falsifiable claims
- Verify: 3-vote adversarial verification per claim (need 2/3 refutes to kill)
- Synthesize: Merge semantic dupes, rank by confidence, cite sources
